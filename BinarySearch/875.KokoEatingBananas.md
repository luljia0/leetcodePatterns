### brute force

k is range from 1 and maxPiles. We can calculate the time neede by every possible k from 1. The first k that makes time is less than h is what we wanna find.

time complexity is $O(maxPile * n)$

### binary search

binary search can optimize the maxPile to log(maxPile)

note that left and right is not the index but the speed

```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        // find the max pile[i]
        int maxPile = 0;
        for(int pile: piles) {
            maxPile = Math.max(maxPile, pile);
        }

        //binary search the array the find the minimum
        int res = maxPile;
        int left = 1;
        int right = maxPile;
        int mid;
        
        while(left < right) {
            int time = 0;
            mid = (left + right) /2;

            //calculate time needed
            for(int pile: piles ) {
                time += Math.ceil((double)pile / mid); // round up here. Pay attention to the typecasting to double or the division will round down 
            }
            // if less than hours, we can try smaller speed
            if(time <= h) {
                right = mid;
                res = Math.min(res, mid);
            }else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }

        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
