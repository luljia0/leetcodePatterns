to have a prices array to store the shortest path so far from source.  If not infinite value, that means this node has been added to the path.

to have a temp array to store the shortest path after adding the new node to the path, that is checking if the new path through new node in prices array  shorter than the previous

Iterate every array in each layer to implement the algorithm

we have at most k stops, so we iterate k + 1 stops at most

the first layer only has the source node itself

```java
class Solution {
    public int findCheapestPrice(int n, int[][] flights, int src, int dst, int k) {
        // initialize an array of prices
        int[] prices = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(prices, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        prices[src] = 0;

        // copy of prices
        
        // iterate at most k + 1 layers
        for(int i = 0; i < k + 1; i++) {
            // new copy here instead of outside the loop because after prices == temp, they refer to the same memory, prices will change as temp change
            int[] temp = new int[n];
            temp = Arrays.copyOf(prices, prices.length);
                
            // iterate every edges
            for(int j = 0; j < flights.length; j++) {
                int s = flights[j][0];
                int d = flights[j][1];
                int p = flights[j][2];
                if(prices[s] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) continue;
                // check the src distance in prices instead of temp because source in prices are those who have been visited
                if(prices[s] + p < temp[d]) {
                    temp[d] = prices[s] + p;
                }
                
            }
            prices = temp;
            
        }

        return prices[dst] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1: prices[dst] ;
        
    }
}
```
