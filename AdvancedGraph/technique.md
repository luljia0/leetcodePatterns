combine graphs with BFS algorithms such as prim's and Dijkstra to find the shortest path

### Prim's Algo

only handle undirected graph

### Dijkstra's

can hable both undirected and directed graph

can't handle graphs with negative edge weights

### Bellman-Ford

Bellman-Ford algorithm can handle graphs with negative edge weights and detect negative cycles,
