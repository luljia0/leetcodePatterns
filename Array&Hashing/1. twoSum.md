### 1 using hashmap

1. build the hashmap(easy to look up by key). because we need the index, so index being the value and number being the key

2. Iterate the array to see if there is another number equals the difference between taget and the current number. Note that the number can't be the current number itself. For example, 3 + 3 = 6. And the number in the array is identical so that we can store them in a hashmap by their value.

   ```java
   class Solution {
       public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
           // an array to store the returned indice
           int[] indice =  new int[2];
           //build a hashmap
           HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
           //add all int to it with int being the key, indice being the value
           for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i ++){
               map.put(nums[i], i);
           }
   
           //ietrate the array
           for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
               //if contains a number and not itself. eg. 3+3 = 6
               if(map.containsKey(target - nums[i]) && map.get(target - nums[i]) != i){
                   indice[0] = i;
                   indice[1] = map.get(target - nums[i]);
                   break;
               }
           }
           return indice;  
       }
   }
   ```

   

### ==2 a more clever way using hashmap==

to deal with the situation that we use the same element twice. Eg. [3, 2, 4] target = 6. The wrong res will be [0, 0];

instead of adding all elements of array to hashmap initially, we add the element after iteration so that we don't need to worry about that the element is used twice, that is 3+3=6 and if we've already find the 2 elements whose sum is target, we don't need to add the left to the hashmap so that space can be saved.

Why we can do that? Because we know that there must be a solution to the problem. And if the first element of the solution can't find the second in the hashmap and then be added to it, then we can find the first element in the hashmap when we go over the second one.

Note that don't need to worry about [3, 3] situation when map only store the [3: 1] because when you iterate the  nums, you have the firts indice of 3, it will still return 0,1

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // an array to store the returned indice
        int[] indice =  new int[2];
        //build a hashmap
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        // //add all int to it with int being the key, indice being the value
        // for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i ++){
        //     map.put(nums[i], i);
        // }

        //ietrate the array
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
            //if doesn't find, add to the hashmap
            if(!map.containsKey(target - nums[i])){
                map.put(nums[i], i);
            }
            //else
            else{
                indice[0] = i;
                indice[1] = map.get(target - nums[i]);
                break;
            }
        }
        return indice;  
    }
}
```
