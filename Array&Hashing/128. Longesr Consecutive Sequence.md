### using hashset

**thinking process:**

Taking the example1 for examole, from the result, we can observe that we have 3 consecutive sequences, which are 1234, 100 and 200. We just need to decide the start and the end of the sequence and simply calculate the length of the sequence. Then

how can we decide the start? start is the  element in arrays that has no left neighbors. We can use set to check whether the left neighbor exists, which takes O(n). And if no, it is the start of the sequence, then we use the same method to keep checking whether its right neighbor exists until it doesn't.

**algorithm**

1. convert the array into set to check whether the left and right neighbor exist in the set in O(1).
2. iterate the array to check whether the element has the left neighbor. If no, it is the start of the sequence. Then keep checking the right neighbor. 
3. return the longest length of the consecutive sequences.

```java
/*
time: O(n); 
space: O(n);
*/
class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        //hashset to store the array
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        //iterate the array and add element to the set
        for(Integer num: nums){
            set.add(num);
        }

        //iterate the array to find the start of the sequence
        int longest = 0; // to keep track the longset length of all consecutive sequences
        for(Integer num: nums){
            if(!set.contains(num-1)){
                int length = 0; //to record the length of the sequence starting from num
                //to find the right neighbor until it doesn't exist
                while(set.contains(num + length)){
                    set.remove(num + length); //remove the element that has been visited;
                    length++;
                    

                }
                longest = Math.max(longest, length);
                

            }
        }
        return longest;
        
    }
}

```
