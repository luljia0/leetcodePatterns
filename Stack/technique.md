1. the stack problem often has 2 groups of variables to iterate. we store one of them in the stack and operate them when encounter another group of them. Because stack can only store variables of the same type
2. stack can add and remove the same element immediately, so it is usually combined with backtrack technique whhich required add and remove oepeartion
3. don't forget to check is stack is empty
