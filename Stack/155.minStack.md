### 2 stacks

the key is to getMin in O(1) time complexity. So we have another stack to store the values with the top one being the minimum all the time by comparing the added value to the top one.

note that it should be popped from both stacks in pop() function, or it will affect the getMin() function. although the popped elements from both stacks could be different, it doesn't affect getMin  because minStack remains the min elements when adding the same level element

```java
class MinStack {

    private Stack<Integer> stack;
    private Stack<Integer> minStack;
    public MinStack() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        minStack = new Stack<>();
    }
    
    public void push(int val) {
        stack.push(val);
        // check if 
        if(minStack.isEmpty()){
            minStack.push(val);

        }else {
            minStack.push(Math.min(val, minStack.peek()));
        }
        
    }
    
    public void pop() {
        
        stack.pop();
        minStack.pop();
        
    }
    
    public int top() {
        return stack.peek();
        
    }
    
    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.peek();
        
    }
}

/**
 * Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MinStack obj = new MinStack();
 * obj.push(val);
 * obj.pop();
 * int param_3 = obj.top();
 * int param_4 = obj.getMin();
 */
```
