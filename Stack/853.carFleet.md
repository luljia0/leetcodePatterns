### stack + sorting

how to decide whether a car fleet? the further car reaches the destination earlier than the closer ones. so we need to sort the array by position first.

```java
class Solution {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        // combine position and speed into a 2d array
        int[][] combo = new int[position.length][2];
        for(int i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
            combo[i][0] = position[i];
            combo[i][1] = speed[i];
        }

        // sort the array by position in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(combo, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        // a stack to add and remove the further car if car fleet because the further one has higher speed and change its spped after collides
        Stack<Double> stack = new Stack<>(); // note that the type is double because we store the time that car reaches the destination

        // iterate the array from right to left because if carfleet, the further one always collided first, then change its spped. So we start from the closer ones;
        for(int i = combo.length -1; i >= 0; i--) {
            double time = (double)(target - combo[i][0]) / combo[i][1]; //don't forgets to do type casting or it is integer
            // if collides
            if(!stack.isEmpty() && time <= stack.peek()) {
                // remove the further one that is the faster one
                continue;
            }else {
                stack.push(time);
            }

        }
        return stack.size();


        
    }
}
```
