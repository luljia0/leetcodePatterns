### bfs

Is similar to 102. They both have a queue and nested loop to traverse the nodes in the same level

be careful of the following situation when there is no child of the last most right node i.e 3 while there is one for the left nodes i.e. 4

so in every iteration of the same level, add every non-null child and only the first polled node(the most right) node can be seen.

- Time complexity: O(N) since one has to visit each node.
- Space complexity: O(D)to keep the queues,
  where D is a tree diameter.
  Let's use the last level to estimate the queue size.
  This level could contain up to N/2 tree nodes in the case of
  [complete binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/).

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> rightSideView(TreeNode root) {
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if(root == null) return res;
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
        queue.add(root);
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                
                TreeNode poll = queue.poll();
              // see the most right (the first in queue)
                if(i == 0) res.add(poll.val);
               // add every non-null nodes from right to left
              if(poll.right != null) {
                    queue.add(poll.right);
                }
                if(poll.left != null) {
                    queue.add(poll.left);
                }
            }


        }
        return res;
        
    }
}
