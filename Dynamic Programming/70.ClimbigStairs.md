### brute force - dfs

to count how many subtrees we have using dfs. The time complexity would be $O(2^n)$

### Optimal -dynamic programming

to reduce the problem into smaller problem by using dp. The time complexity would be $O(n)$.

to do that, we need an array to store the computed result. And we observe that we only need the previous two results and sum them up. So to save the space, we only need 2 variables  and update them for n -1 times to get the nth result.

```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int one = 1;
        int two = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int temp = one;
            one = one + two;
            two = temp;
        }
        return one;
    }
}
```
