There are only 2 choices for each decision either buy/sell or cooldown

you can't buy twice, you can't sell before buy, you can't buy right after sell;

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        // map to cache, key is index - sell/buy, value is the profit so far
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
      // why start from sell
        return dfs(prices, map, true, 0);


        
    }

    public int dfs(int[]prices, HashMap<String, Integer> map, boolean buying, int index) {
        if(index >= prices.length) return 0;

        String key = index +"-" + buying;

        if(map.containsKey(key)) return map.get(key);

        // cool down
        int cooldown = dfs(prices, map, buying, index + 1);

        int profit;
        // if buy, can't buy again
        if(buying) {
            profit = dfs(prices, map, !buying, index + 1) - prices[index];
            // if sell, cool down for one day
          // why can't buy after cooling down
        } else {
            profit = dfs (prices, map, !buying, index + 2) + prices[index];
        }

        map.put(key, Math.max(profit, cooldown));
        return map.get(key);
    }
}
