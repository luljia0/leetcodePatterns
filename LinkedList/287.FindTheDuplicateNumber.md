we can't use hashset and sorting because of constrainsts

### ==Use Floyd's Tortoise&Hare algorithm(slow-fast pointers)==

1. use index and nums of index build a linked list. Because there is duplicate number, i.e same position will be reached twice. so there is a cycle in the linked list. The index of the beginning of the cycle(the node that has 2 enter links) is what we want to find.

2. find the first intersection using floyd tortoise

3. set another pointer starting from the beginning of the list, the index of the next intersection is the reselt. Because the equality of distance 

   slow * 2 = fast

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 0;
        // the first intersection
        while(slow < nums.length) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
            if(slow == fast) break;
        }
        // beginning of the cycle
        int slower = 0;
        while(slower < nums.length) {
            slower = nums[slower];
            slow = nums[slow];
            if(slow == slower) break;
        }
        return slow;
        
    }
}
```
