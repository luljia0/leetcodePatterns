### use hashset

If we reach the same node we have visited before, there is a cycle. We use hashset to store the visited nodes. Note that we store the ListNode in hashset instead of the value cause we may have duplicate values for different nodes.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        HashSet<ListNode> set = new HashSet<>();
        while(head != null) {
            if(set.contains(head)) return true;
            set.add(head);
            head = head.next;
        }
        return false;
        
    }
}
```

### ==Use Floyd's Tortoise&Hare algorithm(slow-fast pointers)==

slow moves one step a time while fast moves two steps a time. while they meet, means there is a cycle. Because assume that they are in different position of the cycle, because they have one step difference, so if there is a cycle, fast will always catch up with the slow in less than n(n is the length of cycle) steps.

Note that because fast move 2 steps a time, so the loop condition should make sure that the fast(when the linked list is odd) and fast.next( when the linked list is even)are both not null

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if(head == null) return false;
        // slow-fast pointers
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while(fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if(slow == fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
        
    }
}
```
