### 2 pointers

The general idea of slow-fast pointers are to go through all of the cases despite those which are obviously not the best solution so that we can reduce the time complexity. In this problem, instead of brute forth all the buy and sell cases, we can simply skip the cases that has higher buy price by checking the profit is greater than zero or not. Only if it has a lower buy price, we move the slow pointer, or we just simply move the faster pointer.

the condition of the slide window is profit > 0; when it is not valid, we move the slower pointer 

in the window, the sell price is higher than buy price, so it is impossible that it has a higher profit if sell price is any of the prices in the window, so the selling price can go straight down to the lower selling price

1. Left pointer is the day to buy, right pointer is the day to sell. Right pointer is always bigger than left pointer(this is guranteed by our way to increment)

2. Maxpro to keep track of the max profit so far. Because we don't have to know where to sell and buy so we don't have to keep track of that.

3. move the right forward and make sure that it is profitable(prices[right] > prices[left]). If not, update the left to where right pointer is at. by doing this, you may find the first point to buy to make profit(left-right = 1)or the poosible lower price to buy.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxPro = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = 1;
        while(right < prices.length) {
            if(prices[left] < prices[right]) {
                int profit = prices[right] - prices[left];
                maxPro = Math.max(maxPro, profit);
            }else{
                left = right;
            }
            right++;       
        }  
    return maxPro;       
    }
}
```
