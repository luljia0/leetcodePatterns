### slide window

the essence of the slide window technique is the slow-fast pointer> The fast pointer is to increase for every iteration. The point is to know when to move the slow pointer

1. for every iteration, move the fast pointer, decide whether the slide window is valid, update the max length
2. when the window is invalid, move the slow pointer and shrink the slide window. 
3. how to decide whether the slide window is valid, the replacement(length of window - most occurences) less or equal than k.
4. how to find the most occurences, an array as an hashmap to store, when the length of slide window is changed, update the occurences. When the window is expaneded, update the most occurences.

```java
class Solution {
    public int characterReplacement(String s, int k) {
        //array as a hashmap to count the occurences
        int[] occur = new int[26];

        // 2 pointer to iterate the array
        int left = 0; 
        int right = 0;
        int max = 0; //max occurences
        int res = 0;
        for(right = 0; right < s.length(); right ++){
            //count the oocurences
            occur[s.charAt(right) - 'A'] ++; 
            //find the biggest occurences only when right pointer moved, that is the slide window is enlarged
            max = Math.max(max, occur[s.charAt(right) - 'A']);
            //to justify whether the slide window is valid
            if(right - left + 1 - max > k){
                //update the occurence but don't update the max
                occur[s.charAt(left) - 'A'] --; 
                //shrink the slide window
                left++;
            }
            res = Math.max(right - left + 1, res);

            

        }
        return res;
        
    }
}
```
