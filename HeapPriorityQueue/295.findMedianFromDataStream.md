### brute force

use an array or list to store the numbers to make sure it's in-order. Every time  you add an number, you need to check all of numbers in array/list and insert it. insertion is O(n)

Find a median is to find the medium element in array/list. find is O(n)/O(1)



### use priority queue

use 2 heaps, one contains smaller numbers while the other contains bigger. 

1. all of numbers in smallHeap is smaller than largeHeap
2. the size of both heap is equal or different by 1.

The findMin/max operation  in heap is O(1); add and remove operation is O(logn)

```java
class MedianFinder {
    private Queue<Integer> smallHeap; //mazHeap
    private Queue<Integer> largeHeap; //minHeap

    public MedianFinder() {
        smallHeap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>((a, b) -> b - a);
        largeHeap = new PriorityQueue<Integer>((a, b) -> a - b);
    }
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        // add it to smallHeap by default;
        smallHeap.add(num);

        // condition1: the number of integers in smallHeap and largeHeap is equal or different by 1;
        if(smallHeap.size() - largeHeap.size() > 1) {
            largeHeap.add(smallHeap.poll());
        }

        //condition2: numbers in smallHeap is smaller than those in largeHeap
        if(largeHeap.size() >= 1) {
            if(smallHeap.peek() > largeHeap.peek()) {
                largeHeap.add(smallHeap.poll()); 
            }  
        }
        //check the size again. Because when large.size - small.size == 1, after condition2, largeHeap.size may 2 more than smallHeap();

        if (largeHeap.size() - smallHeap.size() > 1) {
            smallHeap.add(largeHeap.poll());
        }
    }
    
    public double findMedian() {
        if(smallHeap.size() == largeHeap.size()) {
            return (double)(smallHeap.peek() + largeHeap.peek()) / 2;
        }else if (smallHeap.size() - largeHeap.size() == 1) {
            return (double)smallHeap.peek();
        }else {
            return (double)largeHeap.peek();
        }
        
    }
}

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MedianFinder obj = new MedianFinder();
 * obj.addNum(num);
 * double param_2 = obj.findMedian();
 */
```

### optimal

1. Make sure large heap is always the bigger one, so we don't have to worry about the situation when small heap is bigger in findMedian() funciton

2. when adding the number, make sure the biggest in small heap is smaller than the smallest in large heap by checking the if added number is smaller than the smallest 

   ```java
   class MedianFinder {
       private PriorityQueue<Integer> small;
       private PriorityQueue<Integer> large;
   
       public MedianFinder() {
           small = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
           large = new PriorityQueue<>();
       }
       
       public void addNum(int num) {
       
           if(small.isEmpty()){
               large.add(num);
           }else if( num < small.peek()) {
               small.add(num);
           } else {
               large.add(num);
           }
   
           // when large is bigger than small
           if(large.size() - small.size() > 1) {
               while(large.size() - small.size() > 1) {
                   small.add(large.poll());
               }
           }else {
               while(!(small.size() == large.size() || large.size() - small.size() == 1)) {
                   large.add(small.poll());
               }
           }
           
           
       }
       
       public double findMedian() {
           PriorityQueue<Integer> largecopy = large;
           PriorityQueue<Integer> smallcopy = small;
           if(large.size() > small.size()) return (double) large.peek();
           return (double) (small.peek() + large.peek()) /2;
           
       }
   }
   
   /**
    * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
    * MedianFinder obj = new MedianFinder();
    * obj.addNum(num);
    * double param_2 = obj.findMedian();
    */
   ```
