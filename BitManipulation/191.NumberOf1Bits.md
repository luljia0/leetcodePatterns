### modular

the modular to decide whether the last digit is 1. moving n to right by 1. n doesn't change

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            res += n % 2;
            n  >>= 1; // shift right by 1 in CPU; the original n stays the same.
        }
        return res;
        
    }
}
```

### logical operation

&00001 to decide the last bit is 1 or not

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++){
            if((n & 1)!= 0 ) res++;
            n  >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
        
    }
}
```

### Optimal(flipping)

n = n & (n-1) can only check the digit who is 1. because this operation equals to get rid of the 1 digit. n changes. the time complexity is still O(1)
